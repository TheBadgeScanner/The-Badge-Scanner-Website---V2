I will prompt you using explicit instructions and provide you with the name of the page where I am seeing the item that needs updating.

Only make the changes that are specifically requested. Leave all other pages untouched anddo not make any other changes that have not been specifically requested.

If any unstructions I give you are unclear or ambiguous, highlight this in your chat response / post-build summary rather than guessing at what I meant.

In your chat response / post-build summary you can include suggestions for improvements.
