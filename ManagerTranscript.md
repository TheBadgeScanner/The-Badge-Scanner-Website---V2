[0:05:32] Nick Thompson: It.
[0:08:44] Nick Thompson: Nick Thompson joined
[0:08:50] Albert Stoykov: Hello.
[0:08:51] Nick Thompson: Good morning. How we doing? Good.
[0:08:56] Albert Stoykov: Surviving.
[0:08:58] Nick Thompson: Surviving. Did you do a late one?
[0:09:01] Albert Stoykov: Oh, a few ones, yeah. A few ones, yeah.
[0:09:09] Albert Stoykov: I feel like I've crammed a month's worth of work in the last three days since Friday.
[0:09:16] Nick Thompson: Oh, really?
[0:09:18] Albert Stoykov: So, yeah, I'm very. Happy, actually. Tired, but happy. I didn't think I'll be able to push this much.
[0:09:30] Albert Stoykov: This much too. So I'm yeah, very happy with that.
[0:09:37] Nick Thompson: What's been the challenge with it?
[0:09:40] Albert Stoykov: Well, I mean, my initial thought was I'll have to trudge to FIGMA make.
[0:09:47] Albert Stoykov: But then their constant server issues kind of pushed me to basically all of the code locally.
[0:09:55] Albert Stoykov: And then I started working on it through VS code and then I started using Copilot.
[0:10:02] Albert Stoykov: And then, yeah, one thing led to another and here we are and I, even I, even I.
[0:10:09] Albert Stoykov: Then I thought like, I made quite a few changes and I was like, well, how do I put this back in Figma Mix so I can share it with you guys?
[0:10:16] Nick Thompson: Right.
[0:10:16] Albert Stoykov: And it turns out they don't have that functionality.
[0:10:20] Nick Thompson: No, not surprised at that.
[0:10:22] Nick Thompson: I was actually surprised that you could get it into the Microsoft side of things.
[0:10:27] Nick Thompson: But then I suppose Figma gives you all the REACT code, so anything you'd hope that anything that can process REACT would pick it up.
[0:10:35] Nick Thompson: Right?
[0:10:36] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. So essentially I pulled everything we had so far in figma and then I got.
[0:10:41] Albert Stoykov: I didn't, I didn't use anymore. It was, it was helpful from time to time.
[0:10:46] Albert Stoykov: So I still had it open because sometimes you know how you can select a specific element and see where that is exactly in the code.
[0:10:53] Albert Stoykov: So it helped me quite a few times with that. But other than that I just used vs code and copilot.
[0:10:59] Albert Stoykov: I put everything on GitHub and then, yeah, deployed that to a URL so I can share it with you guys.
[0:11:10] Albert Stoykov: So, yeah, so yeah, this morning, last night and this morning I've been working on the, on the comments you, you gave us yesterday.
[0:11:18] Nick Thompson: Okay, great.
[0:11:19] Albert Stoykov: And then hope.
[0:11:21] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, my plan is to go through those now and then do any additional changes to the rest of the day so we can.
[0:11:29] Albert Stoykov: So we're in a good place to send that to Zip, right?
[0:11:34] Albert Stoykov: Okay, but what's your overall feeling when you had a look at it yesterday? Does it look like it's.
[0:11:44] Albert Stoykov: Getting to a point where, where we can send that to Zia or you still think it's a long way away?
[0:11:52] Nick Thompson: Just what I said in the email really last yesterday, I felt like.
[0:11:59] Nick Thompson: Super Admin was kind of focused on slightly the wrong things in in the, you know, we're.
[0:12:05] Nick Thompson: We're not looking for stats. We're. We're using it as an administration tool to support us with.
[0:12:14] Nick Thompson: With dealing with issues and seeing issues come up before they.
[0:12:18] Nick Thompson: Before they become bigger issues and so forth. So.
[0:12:23] Nick Thompson: So, I mean, in terms of the look of it, it's, you know, it's great.
[0:12:26] Nick Thompson: It kind of like, you know, it continues on.
[0:12:28] Nick Thompson: It hasn't sort of broken the mold from what we've done for the rest of it, you know, for.
[0:12:34] Nick Thompson: With figma, it's. It's kept the look. So it's good that you're able to. Work with that and.
[0:12:45] Nick Thompson: You know, make adjustments, as you said, without, you know, kind of unintentional things happening on the side, the sort of side effects.
[0:12:53] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah, I did. I did find that with Copilot, it was much better. Like, it. Not. It.
[0:12:58] Albert Stoykov: It wasn't like with figma, make I ask it to do one thing and then it breaks five other things.
[0:13:03] Albert Stoykov: It would, it would be. It would be like. Because it has access to the whole. Code base, it's basically.
[0:13:11] Albert Stoykov: I'm basically telling it within this file, I'm looking to change this specific thing or, or it can even like, read multiple files and then decide what it needs to change.
[0:13:20] Albert Stoykov: So it's been. Been very good. The Godsend, honestly.
[0:13:23] Nick Thompson: Yeah. Okay. And it's faster to work with you.
[0:13:26] Albert Stoykov: Saying, oh, yeah, definitely.
[0:13:28] Albert Stoykov: Like, it will still get stuck at times, so I'll have to, like, try to explain in a different way or even like, start a new chat, but very, very rarely.
[0:13:38] Albert Stoykov: Like, most of the time, like 60, 70% of the time, I'll tell it what I need it to do, and it would do it, like, just like that.
[0:13:45] Albert Stoykov: So it's amazing.
[0:13:46] Albert Stoykov: It's like, it's like Angie keeps saying, like, I even started using sports speech to text so that I don't have to type all the time.
[0:13:54] Albert Stoykov: And Angie's like, what? What are you doing? And Maya can hear me talk.
[0:14:00] Albert Stoykov: And she's like, dad, Daddy's on the phone. I'm like, no, I'm speaking to my best friend.
[0:14:06] Albert Stoykov: I'm talking my way into our website. So, yeah, it's been good.
[0:14:13] Nick Thompson: Nice. Okay, well, good, good. Well, I'm on it at the moment. Should we have a poke around?
[0:14:19] Nick Thompson: I see it's updated since yesterday.
[0:14:21] Albert Stoykov: Yes, yes. Do you want to share your screen?
[0:14:26] Nick Thompson: Yeah, I can do that.
[0:14:32] Albert Stoykov: Based on your comments. I worked on the super Admin. Dashboard and added quite a few things.
[0:14:41] Nick Thompson: Nick Thompson started sharing their screen
[0:14:43] Albert Stoykov: One of them is the calendar that. That actually shows you. Upcoming events.
[0:14:49] Nick Thompson: Yep.
[0:14:50] Albert Stoykov: And you can click on those and go to the specific event. Wait, that's not it. Do you want to re.
[0:14:57] Albert Stoykov: Refresh that.
[0:15:01] Nick Thompson: Super admin?
[0:15:03] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, there we go. So, yeah, so you can hover on the dates now.
[0:15:08] Albert Stoykov: It can show you the event that's happening.
[0:15:13] Albert Stoykov: It's even showing you sometimes when there's like multiple events on the same day.
[0:15:18] Albert Stoykov: So you can, you can click on those and it would take you to that specific event.
[0:15:23] Albert Stoykov: I'm not 100% happy with how it looks at the moment.
[0:15:26] Albert Stoykov: I was trying to create like animation that basically like.
[0:15:34] Albert Stoykov: Fills that specific cell that has multiple events. To basically like either show one or the other.
[0:15:43] Albert Stoykov: But I was struggling with that, so I didn't want to waste too much time on that.
[0:15:47] Albert Stoykov: We can, we can, we can work on that.
[0:15:50] Nick Thompson: Yeah. And it's really, you know, for us, it's functionality, isn't. It doesn't have to be beautiful.
[0:15:57] Albert Stoykov: But we could, we could, we could potentially add this to the other user levels if you think it might be, might be helpful.
[0:16:06] Albert Stoykov: Like for the, for the event organizers, for example, because they'll have, they might have like multiple events in the month as well.
[0:16:12] Albert Stoykov: So it will be, it'll be easy for them to click on those.
[0:16:15] Nick Thompson: Yeah. Okay. And then if you click on it, you get that conference. Okay. Then a few OSes.
[0:16:22] Nick Thompson: That's why you've got it split colors. Because.
[0:16:29] Albert Stoykov: You have to click back on system admin.
[0:16:31] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, it's just to differentiate between the different, different events.
[0:16:36] Nick Thompson: Okay. So if you go more than two on a day. You'Re gonna get a bit fiddly.
[0:16:41] Albert Stoykov: Well, I have told it to basically split, split into, into three.
[0:16:47] Albert Stoykov: I haven't actually tested that, but yeah, that's, that's, that's the idea.
[0:16:53] Nick Thompson: Okay. I think it would be a, a bit of a strange interface if you started splitting this down.
[0:16:59] Nick Thompson: I've never seen that before and it feels like it's kind of all right with two, but it feels like it would probably start to scale a bit strangely, you know, like, am I going to be looking for the little bit of blue that I can click on?
[0:17:12] Nick Thompson: Yeah. So.
[0:17:17] Nick Thompson: I think it's probably a good thing to see the calendar and see events coming up, but I wouldn't get too obsessed with the color charting side of things.
[0:17:29] Nick Thompson: I think if you saw, you know, if I could see on a certain date there were four events.
[0:17:38] Albert Stoykov: I could make the tool tips themselves be clickable.
[0:17:41] Nick Thompson: So yeah, as long as you, as long as they're not that sort of any of the fun ones that sort of, you know, when you, you'd move.
[0:17:48] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[0:17:48] Nick Thompson: They seem fine at the moment, but if, you know, like, sometimes you go to click on something on the tooltip, it disappears when you move your mouse.
[0:17:56] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[0:17:56] Nick Thompson: So as long as that doesn't happen, then we're good.
[0:18:00] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[0:18:04] Nick Thompson: I think as long as it scales reasonably well.
[0:18:07] Nick Thompson: I mean, right now, you know, the maximum I can probably foresee us having in, in one day is probably five or six, you know, so you can kind of build towards that.
[0:18:18] Nick Thompson: I mean, we had that week where we had six or seven week.
[0:18:24] Albert Stoykov: Well, hopefully we want every week to be like that.
[0:18:26] Nick Thompson: Well, yeah, exactly.
[0:18:27] Nick Thompson: I want to, I want it to increase, and I just don't want to sort of build something where if it increases that we suddenly think, oh.
[0:18:35] Nick Thompson: Because we didn't actually think about that. So, you know, even if you have.
[0:18:44] Nick Thompson: A list of different events come up in the tooltip, you need that to be scalable.
[0:18:51] Nick Thompson: So at the moment, if you look at my screen, I could maybe fit five or six in there, and then that would.
[0:18:57] Nick Thompson: After that, it might become a bit of a problem.
[0:18:59] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. So, I mean, we could, yeah, you.
[0:19:05] Nick Thompson: Could lose some of the date stuff here, which is already in the calendar, effectively.
[0:19:09] Nick Thompson: You could lose that date line. Yeah, that would mean you get a few more in.
[0:19:16] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, and, and I'm sure we could be.
[0:19:18] Albert Stoykov: We could add a scroll to it as well if there's multiple events and you can scroll through them and click on the specific one you're you're after.
[0:19:28] Albert Stoykov: And yeah, in the upcoming events, I, I, yeah, I added what you, what you mentioned that you can click on that as well.
[0:19:35] Albert Stoykov: So if you hover it, you can, you can see that these are all clickable. Now.
[0:19:40] Albert Stoykov: I would take you to the specific event.
[0:19:42] Nick Thompson: Right.
[0:19:46] Albert Stoykov: Also, the same applies for the potential issues and the recently finished events.
[0:19:54] Albert Stoykov: I've added scroll on those to basically show Zia how we want this to look when there's, like, multiple things.
[0:20:00] Albert Stoykov: So I don't, I don't want the thing to keep expanding. I want it to be like, scrollable.
[0:20:09] Nick Thompson: Yeah, that's good.
[0:20:10] Albert Stoykov: And then also the icons are tool tips. So, like, upcoming events says, like in the next seven days.
[0:20:18] Albert Stoykov: And then potential issues says.
[0:20:21] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, next seven days, or like next seven days, and then completed events in the last seven days or something like that.
[0:20:31] Nick Thompson: Right.
[0:20:32] Albert Stoykov: So this is all, like, filtered so we don't see things too far, too far in the past, which we don't need.
[0:20:41] Nick Thompson: Okay, great. I'm struggling with no back button. I Keep going to the back button.
[0:20:48] Albert Stoykov: I mean that'll be easy to add. If you want, I can. Put that somewhere. The question is where?
[0:20:57] Albert Stoykov: Top left or.
[0:20:58] Nick Thompson: Oh no, I mean the browser button sort of doesn't. It doesn't move on, does it?
[0:21:04] Nick Thompson: When you click on something, I mean, I guess it must see it as being the same page.
[0:21:09] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. The URL stays the same. So it's like a static. It's a static page. It doesn't have like different.
[0:21:19] Albert Stoykov: URLs.
[0:21:20] Nick Thompson: Yeah, that's different from the figma, isn't it?
[0:21:25] Nick Thompson: I wonder if that's just something that can be turned on or off with react.
[0:21:30] Albert Stoykov: What's different from the figma?
[0:21:32] Nick Thompson: Sorry. So in figma, if I, I believe. Let me see if I've got.
[0:21:48] Nick Thompson: I go into a page and then I click on.
[0:21:53] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, I don't think you can click on any others.
[0:22:01] Nick Thompson: Out. Maybe it wasn't different. So I go log out. It's clicking on popups. Popups, isn't it?
[0:22:20] Nick Thompson: So if I go to team and I click on one of those guys.
[0:22:27] Albert Stoykov: Maybe if you click on change event.
[0:22:32] Nick Thompson: Right now, you're right, it's the same. It's got a back button there either.
[0:22:38] Nick Thompson: I've not noticed that before. Strange. Okay.
[0:22:42] Albert Stoykov: I think it's because it's treating as a static page. So all the.
[0:22:46] Albert Stoykov: There's no actual navigation happening. It's just based on, on the code and the code base, right?
[0:22:53] Nick Thompson: Yeah. Okay. It just felt strange there from a user point of view.
[0:22:58] Nick Thompson: I kept going to the back button and then going, oh no, I can't.
[0:23:00] Nick Thompson: I've got to find the right place on the, on the. On the page.
[0:23:09] Albert Stoykov: I mean we could, we could always include like, you know, you know how at the moment when you, when you use like two fingers on your, on your mouse pad, if you like swipe left, it could take them back.
[0:23:27] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[0:23:27] Albert Stoykov: I can potentially put this on the website or like when they, if they hover over to the, the very left, then that might open up like make a back button appear so they can click on that if they want to take them back to the previous page.
[0:23:46] Nick Thompson: Okay. I mean, I guess we'll get used to it, but we've got a bunch of people that we can't train as.
[0:23:53] Nick Thompson: You know, they kind of, you know, they'll use it how they use it.
[0:23:59] Nick Thompson: So we just need to make sure that it feels user friendly from that point of view.
[0:24:06] Nick Thompson: And you know, intuitively, you know, I'd expect when something changed on the title here, I'd expect To be able to get back and go to the previous one.
[0:24:17] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah. Which I'm sure will be the case when there's an actual website. That'S published.
[0:24:26] Albert Stoykov: Because this is a static website.
[0:24:28] Nick Thompson: That.
[0:24:28] Albert Stoykov: That's why there is.
[0:24:31] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[0:24:32] Albert Stoykov: You think?
[0:24:33] Nick Thompson: So it might be worth checking in with Zir on it when he. When he goes to work on that.
[0:24:39] Nick Thompson: Okay, so back to System Dashboard.
[0:24:56] Albert Stoykov: The. The issues inside the inbox, those are. Those are clickable as well. Now it takes you to the.
[0:25:01] Albert Stoykov: To the specific event as well. Okay.
[0:25:05] Nick Thompson: Not the issues themselves, in a way. It's not going to highlight those issues to me.
[0:25:08] Nick Thompson: And I was thinking about this yesterday. That's not easy to do. I'm not saying that. I'm just.
[0:25:13] Nick Thompson: Putting it out there for thought, really, that If I go 23 unmatched scans.
[0:25:21] Nick Thompson: This gives us an extra job, doesn't it, to kind of go and find those 23 much scans. We haven't got a.
[0:25:29] Nick Thompson: I mean.
[0:25:31] Albert Stoykov: It wouldn't be too hard for me to add some more mock data that's actually like empty.
[0:25:39] Albert Stoykov: Empty leads that don't have emails, for example.
[0:25:44] Nick Thompson: Excuse me.
[0:25:48] Albert Stoykov: Sorry, my. My voice is gone. I've been talking to it too much with my.
[0:25:52] Nick Thompson: Sound like you're warming up for the opera. Then. The. You could.
[0:25:59] Nick Thompson: You could open this lead screen with filters already applied.
[0:26:03] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[0:26:04] Nick Thompson: Adding a filter type for unmatched. Yeah, that would make a lot of sense.
[0:26:10] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. And then same with like the other issues, like the companies that are not active, etc.
[0:26:20] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah.
[0:26:22] Nick Thompson: Anything you can do with that to kind of. Yeah. Get you to the final step would be. Be great.
[0:26:28] Nick Thompson: Do we want to see zeros here if there are. If there aren't any, or just take it.
[0:26:32] Nick Thompson: Take the whole thing away?
[0:26:34] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, I don't think it needs to be there if there's zero.
[0:26:41] Nick Thompson: Also, if you've got. You've got the event mentioned here.
[0:26:48] Nick Thompson: So if there were five inactive exhibitors on Tech Conference and another five on Innovation Summit, do we get two of these?
[0:26:55] Albert Stoykov: Yes.
[0:26:57] Nick Thompson: Okay. Okay. So it might end up being quite a list here, potentially. Yeah. Okay.
[0:27:18] Nick Thompson: Intuitively, this is a date area. Yeah. This is a to do with list of events.
[0:27:26] Nick Thompson: This is to do with list of events. This is to do with list of events.
[0:27:31] Nick Thompson: And this one right in the middle of it isn't so intuitively that that and that belong together like in like as you know.
[0:27:39] Nick Thompson: So maybe, maybe we. We switch. Maybe bring the calendar down to here.
[0:27:45] Nick Thompson: Put the issues up here, and then you've got your calendar upcoming recently. Completed.
[0:27:54] Albert Stoykov: From, from my point of view, I just wanted to separate the upcoming and the recently completed because I did.
[0:27:58] Albert Stoykov: I didn't want them to be next to each other because then you might mix up the two.
[0:28:03] Albert Stoykov: That's why I put the potential issues between them.
[0:28:08] Albert Stoykov: And I, I do, from my point of view, I do think the, the calendar should be at the top. Right.
[0:28:13] Albert Stoykov: Because it, it's very easy to scan through what's upcoming and you can click on a specific event because I think, I think that will be, that'll be the most helpful.
[0:28:25] Albert Stoykov: And then after that point, if you do want to see the potential issues, then you can scroll further down and see what, what needs action.
[0:28:33] Nick Thompson: Right.
[0:28:40] Albert Stoykov: I mean for something like this, I like, we can always move that around afterwards.
[0:28:46] Nick Thompson: Yeah. Okay.
[0:28:48] Albert Stoykov: Is there, is there anything that you think we, we should include additionally on this page?
[0:28:56] Albert Stoykov: I think I'm, I'm happy with, with this as, as a start.
[0:29:07] Nick Thompson: No, I don't think there's anything extra that I'd be looking for.
[0:29:11] Albert Stoykov: Cool. I did, I did think I w. I wanted to leave those figures at the top.
[0:29:19] Albert Stoykov: So we can, we can always brag, take a quick snipe and.
[0:29:23] Albert Stoykov: Hey guys, we've reached 100000 leads on the new app in record. In record time.
[0:29:31] Nick Thompson: I. I guess so. Yeah. Okay.
[0:29:33] Albert Stoykov: A quick, a very quick LinkedIn post. So. Yeah. And yeah, if.
[0:29:45] Albert Stoykov: Do you think I should take anything from here and put it in the event organizer dashboard.
[0:29:54] Albert Stoykov: So one level down, I think the calendar would be helpful. Yeah.
[0:30:09] Albert Stoykov: I agree with you that like all these figures for all of the combined events might not be the most helpful thing for them.
[0:30:17] Albert Stoykov: And then they, they have to scroll down every time to get to the companies.
[0:30:21] Albert Stoykov: So I feel like this should look similar to the super Admin dashboard.
[0:30:26] Albert Stoykov: Rather than showing the event organizers, it shows their events and then it shows the calendar on top with all the.
[0:30:33] Albert Stoykov: Of the events that are happening that month.
[0:30:43] Nick Thompson: Yeah, I'm, I'm totally in agreement on. Cross event stats not meaning much.
[0:30:56] Nick Thompson: The only exception I can think with that is things like say arena, where.
[0:31:02] Nick Thompson: Even then they're going to want say for instance, what's our total leads this year versus total league last year?
[0:31:08] Nick Thompson: They're not going to want total leads in all time because you know that started in April 2026 and you're looking at in December.
[0:31:16] Nick Thompson: Well, what does that mean? What are you going to do with that stat?
[0:31:18] Nick Thompson: It's kind of like 18 months of data a bit strange. So. I agree. That this cross.
[0:31:32] Nick Thompson: Event stuff is kind of Limited. Usefulness.
[0:31:38] Albert Stoykov: I mean, it might still be helpful for them, like you say, for, for a big client like arena, for them to look.
[0:31:47] Albert Stoykov: At overall figures for the whole.
[0:31:51] Albert Stoykov: For the whole, for all the events or for the events in the last year.
[0:31:56] Albert Stoykov: So they can, they can, they can see like in a glance how many users have used the app, how many total leads they've captured, what's their, like intel score, etc.
[0:32:07] Albert Stoykov: Etc. And that, that lead, that graph leads this year, that, that can easily be made in two years.
[0:32:17] Albert Stoykov: So it could be 2024, 2025, 2026.
[0:32:20] Albert Stoykov: So just with a click, they can, they can see like the leads that have happened throughout the years on them.
[0:32:30] Nick Thompson: You haven't got a continual event going through the year.
[0:32:33] Nick Thompson: You've got, you know, a big event here and a small event here and, you know, few medium events sort of dotted around here.
[0:32:41] Nick Thompson: So the bumps you're going to see are just going to be related to what events you have, rather than being something that.
[0:32:52] Nick Thompson: It doesn't suit a curve.
[0:32:57] Nick Thompson: Because it doesn't, you know, like, if you had two events in the same month, you're just going to see like a bigger bump there.
[0:33:03] Nick Thompson: But what's the question of that? Answers? I don't think it really does. I don't think it's.
[0:33:11] Nick Thompson: Interesting inside the event. Yeah.
[0:33:17] Nick Thompson: I just think we need to get some focus on, you know, stuff that's useful to people.
[0:33:24] Nick Thompson: So I'm thinking from say, Wedgebox point of view.
[0:33:30] Nick Thompson: Actually from their point of view at organizer level, this isn't, you know, none of this stuff really is helping unless they take a real interest in going, oh, let's try and get our conversion score up across all our events.
[0:33:44] Nick Thompson: You know, let's push that and try and, you know, get people to capture more and so forth.
[0:33:50] Nick Thompson: But I think really this, you know, I have this in mind much for the event, you know, to look at one event and then go, this event's, you know, got a high conversion possibility for any exhibitors that go there.
[0:34:05] Nick Thompson: You know, if it's low for an event, well, you know, then it's alerting the organizer.
[0:34:11] Nick Thompson: Maybe something you can do to try and boost, you know, get a better audience, get a more relevant audience, those sorts of things.
[0:34:19] Nick Thompson: So comparing one event to another, whereas seeing across the whole organizer spectrum. I don't know.
[0:34:29] Nick Thompson: I don't know how helpful that stuff is. And it sounds like you're broadly agreeing.
[0:34:35] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I do think the, the calendar and the events need to be at the very top.
[0:34:42] Albert Stoykov: I do, I Do think these, these figures can, can still be present?
[0:34:47] Albert Stoykov: Because like that, that's what raises the question like if they've used the app for the last year, they can go into events specifically to see for example their conversion score for each event individually.
[0:35:00] Albert Stoykov: I think you, it wouldn't harm for them to have a page like this where they can see the conversion rate across all the events.
[0:35:10] Albert Stoykov: And then they could investigate further and see which one, which one, which one's higher, which one's lower and then how to, how to improve.
[0:35:20] Albert Stoykov: The lower ones.
[0:35:26] Albert Stoykov: But yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't mind if, if you wanna, if you want to remove those.
[0:35:46] Nick Thompson: I certainly think this, this isn't relevant for this level, the company performance. Actually.
[0:35:52] Nick Thompson: These three aren't. So I think this whole middle section definitely can go from this view. Okay.
[0:36:06] Nick Thompson: Yeah, it's much more relevant to this. So let's go back up and see.
[0:36:24] Nick Thompson: I guess he's developing it anyway.
[0:36:26] Nick Thompson: I guess it's not harm, it's no harm to have it here. Those top four. The total leads.
[0:36:37] Nick Thompson: I don't know what time frame that would be. That's like all time or something.
[0:36:50] Nick Thompson: It's really negligible benefit. I hear you on, you know, like, okay, if we go kind of. Oh, what's.
[0:37:00] Nick Thompson: Tech Conference has got a 4.8 conversion score. You kind of want a bar to compare to, to go. What's.
[0:37:10] Nick Thompson: What'S the, is that good or bad? So having an average of that across all your events is not.
[0:37:20] Nick Thompson: Completely useless. Neither is lead quality.
[0:37:51] Nick Thompson: This is really where the meat is for them, isn't it?
[0:37:55] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah.
[0:38:02] Nick Thompson: I think we shouldn't have them having to scroll down. Well we, we don't want to scroll down to that.
[0:38:08] Nick Thompson: It's more the point actually. We should, we should bring that up top.
[0:38:15] Nick Thompson: And then maybe we put the, some of these things underneath if we think we're going to keep those.
[0:38:22] Nick Thompson: Yeah, Lose these, these ones.
[0:38:24] Albert Stoykov: Alright.
[0:38:40] Nick Thompson: I think lose these as well.
[0:38:43] Albert Stoykov: Okay.
[0:38:43] Nick Thompson: They're adding much and then just pop. Yeah, pop these underneath it and that's it.
[0:38:49] Albert Stoykov: Okay.
[0:38:58] Nick Thompson: Then you're going to put visitors in here, aren't you? Send location.
[0:39:08] Albert Stoykov: Oh, is this where you went? Yeah, that was one of the things I was meaning to, to ask. Okay.
[0:39:15] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, I can, I can exchange that.
[0:39:23] Nick Thompson: All right. So that's not too much to do on there, is it?
[0:39:25] Nick Thompson: It's just moving stuff around really and removing stuff. Okay.
[0:39:34] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[0:39:34] Nick Thompson: I kind of, you know, made the point in the email.
[0:39:36] Nick Thompson: I'm sort of, I'm finding The navigation bit odd as well.
[0:39:44] Nick Thompson: You know, let's say for instance, you know, when I come back to it and I've not looked at it for a while, it's not clear to me that that is a button.
[0:39:52] Nick Thompson: Unless you roll over it, it looks like a title. So I'm thinking am I on the System Dashboard?
[0:39:58] Nick Thompson: If I go, at the moment I am on the System Dashboard but if I go to here and I go into an event, it still says System Dashboard.
[0:40:07] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, this is only for the super admin. I didn't focus on those buttons.
[0:40:12] Albert Stoykov: The lower levels have, have more buttons.
[0:40:16] Albert Stoykov: So if you log out and log back in there should be more, more buttons available.
[0:40:22] Nick Thompson: So Event admin.
[0:40:24] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So you've got your Event dashboard and you can select an event.
[0:40:39] Nick Thompson: Okay.
[0:40:45] Albert Stoykov: Then I also, I did make the export buttons a bit more standardized. Made them all blue.
[0:40:57] Albert Stoykov: Throughout the different dashboards. Like you suggested.
[0:41:13] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. Also added that, that tab Event admins.
[0:41:18] Albert Stoykov: So. Basically. They can add. Other, other event admins if they wish to.
[0:41:35] Nick Thompson: So you've only, you've only made it blue if it's export. So some sort of color code there going.
[0:41:42] Albert Stoykov: Yeah so all export buttons I've made, I've made blue and then the, the import ones I've, I've kept black for now but we can, obviously we can update that as well.
[0:41:53] Albert Stoykov: And those, those do you want to click on import companies?
[0:41:57] Albert Stoykov: I, I, I reworked that this morning as well.
[0:42:00] Nick Thompson: Okay, cool. Oh, that's good. Yeah.
[0:42:06] Albert Stoykov: You happy with this?
[0:42:08] Nick Thompson: Yeah cool. Yeah.
[0:42:10] Albert Stoykov: So the, the visitor import is the same.
[0:42:40] Nick Thompson: That just be email rather than emails. Yes.
[0:42:55] Nick Thompson: Okay.
[0:42:56] Nick Thompson: I'm, I'm still happy with this, with this screen I'm just the only things again it's just I'm not.
[0:43:02] Nick Thompson: And this is, this is not you, this is, this is, this is me stroke.
[0:43:05] Nick Thompson: Figma is this just doesn't quite sit right. And.
[0:43:13] Nick Thompson: It probably would be taken care of with left hand navigation but then you're taking potentially like an area like this then you're losing all this space underneath it to sort of become a bit useless.
[0:43:26] Nick Thompson: Just wondering if there's a better like.
[0:43:28] Albert Stoykov: I mean not there with, not necessarily because you have, you have a lot of white space on both sides.
[0:43:35] Albert Stoykov: So I know you're looking at it at a, on a massive screen, but it looks, it kind of, I mean.
[0:43:45] Albert Stoykov: It could be like trunk of it if that makes sense.
[0:43:50] Albert Stoykov: So let me, let me share my screen and show you what I mean.
[0:43:56] Nick Thompson: Nick Thompson stopped sharing their screen
[0:43:56] Nick Thompson: Nick Thompson started sharing their screen
[0:43:58] Nick Thompson: Or it could be a hamburger.
[0:43:59] Albert Stoykov: So you know, so, so mine looks like this at the moment.
[0:44:03] Albert Stoykov: So it feels like a lot more zoomed in than yours, but I don't think it's going to harm if, if these get pushed in a bit and then you have a lot more white space here and then a lot more white space here and then the nav barking can basically come in here.
[0:44:19] Albert Stoykov: Right like that.
[0:44:20] Albert Stoykov: So I think there's definitely room for that because this is, this is, this is large enough.
[0:44:26] Nick Thompson: This is super happen.
[0:44:29] Albert Stoykov: It's plenty large. Yeah.
[0:44:31] Nick Thompson: What about other pages though?
[0:44:32] Nick Thompson: Because it's gonna, if you're gonna have an app bar, you're gonna have everywhere, aren't you?
[0:44:38] Nick Thompson: Is that navbar relevant as well for people that are company admins that, you know, kind of.
[0:44:45] Nick Thompson: That's our real focus, isn't it?
[0:44:46] Albert Stoykov: You know, I mean, it, it could be. So this is an admin.
[0:44:51] Albert Stoykov: So you have the team dashboard, you have my dashboard and then you can change the event.
[0:44:56] Albert Stoykov: You could have this in the, in the nav bar in, in a structure.
[0:45:03] Nick Thompson: See if this is loaded.
[0:45:42] Albert Stoykov: So it could be. Structured like this.
[0:45:48] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[0:45:55] Albert Stoykov: So they can look at, like they can basically look at it from a different point of view and see what, what the, what level they're at.
[0:46:05] Albert Stoykov: It will be slightly different because I, I built this in a different way.
[0:46:10] Albert Stoykov: But you could still say show the, the company name. You can show the event above it.
[0:46:14] Albert Stoykov: It could show the, the user. User under it.
[0:46:18] Albert Stoykov: So you can basically click up and down and move that way as well.
[0:46:22] Albert Stoykov: So you can click on the event to change the event.
[0:46:24] Albert Stoykov: You can click on the company to change the company if you're an event admin, for example.
[0:46:32] Nick Thompson: So as, as a, as, as a company, I can. Sorry, keep. Keep it there as a company.
[0:46:44] Nick Thompson: As a company, am I not going to see all that top stuff.
[0:46:49] Albert Stoykov: Company? The company will probably see. This bit.
[0:47:00] Albert Stoykov: I mean you could see the event organizer, but obviously you can't click on that.
[0:47:05] Albert Stoykov: You can see this bit here. So you can click on events to change the event.
[0:47:12] Nick Thompson: You know, one stuff that you can't click on because this is going to confuse people.
[0:47:16] Nick Thompson: If one thing is clickable, then this probably all be clickable, you know, already clear, clear that it's not and why it's not.
[0:47:26] Nick Thompson: Okay, so companies, users, companies.
[0:47:37] Albert Stoykov: These will have to be reworked because that, that website is built in a different way. Right?
[0:47:42] Albert Stoykov: That's based on tabs, the specific company. And we didn't, we didn't go that route.
[0:47:50] Albert Stoykov: So these will have to be changed a bit.
[0:47:59] Nick Thompson: You only really got, as a company, you've Only really got three screens that you potentially are interested in.
[0:48:06] Nick Thompson: You've got your main dashboard, which is why when you log in, that's where you're going.
[0:48:12] Nick Thompson: The main dashboard for the current event, you've got potentially being able to drill down to a team member and see what they've done.
[0:48:23] Nick Thompson: And you've got change event, the list of events. That's it, isn't it?
[0:48:28] Nick Thompson: It's not a lot of, you know, it's not a lot of links, which is kind of, I think, why we've ended.
[0:48:32] Nick Thompson: Ended with it up there in the top. Because it's such a small. Such a small set of options.
[0:48:43] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[0:48:48] Nick Thompson: So would you really have a dash, a nav bar with those three things.
[0:48:56] Nick Thompson: But the user one where you were going to see what particular user's done.
[0:49:01] Nick Thompson: You're not even clicking through to it from, from there, you, you're going.
[0:49:05] Nick Thompson: Going down to the tab there. You just need to wait to get back to your, your team view.
[0:49:18] Albert Stoykov: I'm not sure what you mean, sorry.
[0:49:21] Nick Thompson: So there's no button at the top that says click to see individual team members.
[0:49:26] Nick Thompson: You, you, you scroll down and if you want to see John Doe from the company one, you scroll down and you look at the team tab and you.
[0:49:37] Nick Thompson: And you click on them. So that doesn't even need a link from the main company admin screen.
[0:49:49] Nick Thompson: It doesn't need anything at the top or in the navigation because it's kind of built into the functionality of the page.
[0:49:55] Nick Thompson: You do need a way to get back up. So to the team Dashboard.
[0:49:59] Albert Stoykov: Again.
[0:50:01] Nick Thompson: What'S the difference here between my Dashboard and team Dashboard? Are we logged in as Jane?
[0:50:06] Nick Thompson: So you're in as a user now? No, you're in as. Oh, because Jane. Jane's got her own leads potentially.
[0:50:13] Albert Stoykov: Yes, yes. So these are. That's actually missing. That's missing. Yeah. There should be a Jane Smith here.
[0:50:25] Nick Thompson: So that.
[0:50:26] Albert Stoykov: That's missing part of the breadcrumb. So I need to fix that.
[0:50:31] Albert Stoykov: So, yeah, this breadcrumb is correct because we're looking at the company level, the team dashboard.
[0:50:36] Albert Stoykov: This should have another slash. We say Jane Smith and then we click on someone else.
[0:50:44] Albert Stoykov: Click on someone else, says, there it is my question.
[0:50:49] Albert Stoykov: And then I guess this needs to change again because it's not my dashboard anymore, it's Mike's dashboard.
[0:51:01] Nick Thompson: Do we even need a my dashboard? I think we could possibly get rid of that. And then, you know, if you.
[0:51:10] Nick Thompson: If Jane wants to see her own stuff, she just clicks on Jane and the users.
[0:51:14] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's possible.
[0:51:22] Albert Stoykov: It just means more clicking for the admins, but I guess they've got more functionality, so.
[0:51:29] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[0:51:34] Albert Stoykov: Okay, so do we agree on that? Remove the My dashboard for fradmint. Yeah.
[0:51:41] Nick Thompson: Okay.
[0:51:42] Albert Stoykov: Just have the team dashboard and they can click whatever they want. Are you happy?
[0:51:49] Albert Stoykov: Are you happy with those numbers here? I wasn't sure where else to put them.
[0:51:58] Albert Stoykov: So just left them here for now.
[0:52:03] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[0:52:09] Albert Stoykov: Products.
[0:52:10] Nick Thompson: Okay, cool.
[0:52:17] Albert Stoykov: Let me see what else. We've covered all this. Upcoming events. Clickable. We did that already.
[0:52:29] Albert Stoykov: Potential issues. Yeah, that's also covered. Limited time period. Yep. Inbox items. Clicking. Yep.
[0:52:39] Albert Stoykov: Organize Dashboard. Should say event Organized Dashboard somewhere.
[0:52:49] Nick Thompson: Organizer. Okay. Organizer.
[0:52:53] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. So the reason I've done this, I've basically not added it here is because it already says.
[0:52:59] Albert Stoykov: It here already says Organize Dashboard and that will be like conference badges. So that's.
[0:53:04] Albert Stoykov: That's why I didn't see the need to add it underneath as well. That's why I removed it.
[0:53:13] Nick Thompson: Yeah, but it's not consistent then, is it? As a. I mean, I. I am.
[0:53:20] Nick Thompson: I'm just thinking this whole nav needs a little bit of a reset.
[0:53:25] Albert Stoykov: As.
[0:53:25] Nick Thompson: To how we present it. It's not intuitive.
[0:53:31] Nick Thompson: So I'm going to focus on the fact that it doesn't say organize a dashboard under there.
[0:53:38] Albert Stoykov: It's not too different from.
[0:53:45] Nick Thompson: The current one. That's not a good thing.
[0:53:52] Albert Stoykov: But I think it is different from the point of view of. It's not.
[0:53:59] Albert Stoykov: It's not as verbose, if that makes sense. So.
[0:54:09] Nick Thompson: That's.
[0:54:09] Albert Stoykov: That's quite long already.
[0:54:11] Albert Stoykov: So you've got the account and then the organizer and then the name of the organizer, then the event and the name of the event.
[0:54:19] Albert Stoykov: So I do think. This looks. This looks cleaner when you. When you draw down. I think it's clear.
[0:54:32] Nick Thompson: You know what it doesn't do so well is until you scroll, it doesn't.
[0:54:35] Nick Thompson: It's not necessarily clear when there's one item. And this is a breadcrumb trail, is it?
[0:54:43] Nick Thompson: Especially when there's one item. It's clear when there's four items, I guess.
[0:54:46] Nick Thompson: But whereas the TBS version, one website year on had that kind of slightly differentiated the breadcrumb trail from the rest of it visually with a gray background.
[0:54:58] Nick Thompson: That this doesn't do. Wondering if that's one reason why it's clearer that it's a breadcrumb.
[0:55:10] Albert Stoykov: I think I had an alternative. Thing for this. Yeah. Something like this. But I think that might become.
[0:55:29] Albert Stoykov: A.
[0:55:29] Nick Thompson: Bit too, like too much content.
[0:55:34] Albert Stoykov: Too much content on the page, too much information. Overload.
[0:55:42] Albert Stoykov: And obviously would increase the height of the thing of the breadcrumb.
[0:55:52] Albert Stoykov: I mean, obviously the easiest thing would be to change the color behind this.
[0:55:57] Albert Stoykov: I can make it similar to this color, to the. Top navigation bar. That's how it initially was.
[0:56:05] Albert Stoykov: It was like white and it was separated, but I removed that because I, I thought that this looks like cleaner, more seamless.
[0:56:12] Albert Stoykov: But I, I agree with what you're saying.
[0:56:15] Albert Stoykov: Like, it's kind of like initially you don't even realize that that's a breadcrumb and you can click.
[0:56:27] Nick Thompson: You know, version one. Yeah, version one does it a little bit better in a way.
[0:56:31] Nick Thompson: Never thought I'd say that. With.
[0:56:36] Nick Thompson: It'S, you know, stuff that's clickable is blue, stuff that's not as gray.
[0:56:43] Nick Thompson: It's clearer that there are links there. And then it's got that kind of.
[0:56:49] Nick Thompson: It's got just a little bit of accent coloring just to make it stand out as a breadcrumb.
[0:56:58] Albert Stoykov: Did you want, do you want something similar.
[0:57:04] Nick Thompson: Potentially? Let's see. Can we just flip back again? So, yeah.
[0:57:14] Albert Stoykov: I mean, it, it is kind of similar. So this one's black and when you hover, it changes similarly.
[0:57:22] Albert Stoykov: This one's.
[0:57:22] Nick Thompson: You're on. You're on set conference 2025. Yeah. That seems to be clickable, right? Yes.
[0:57:30] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. And it is.
[0:57:32] Nick Thompson: Which it probably shouldn't be.
[0:57:38] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. So that shouldn't be clickable.
[0:57:43] Nick Thompson: Or it.
[0:57:43] Albert Stoykov: Just takes you back to the change event. If you click on the event name.
[0:58:01] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[0:58:02] Albert Stoykov: When you click on this, it shows you the other events. Then you click on a user, takes you there.
[0:58:17] Albert Stoykov: This should be clickable. So you can, can take you back to the team dashboard.
[0:58:30] Nick Thompson: Just, just putting out there instead of having the change event button at the top.
[0:58:33] Nick Thompson: What if the broadcast trail started with events? Unless you're a super admin, you know. But for.
[0:58:41] Albert Stoykov: You mean like this?
[0:58:43] Nick Thompson: Yeah. Why doesn't it, why doesn't it do that for. When you're in an event?
[0:58:52] Albert Stoykov: Well, that was one of the things I wasn't too sure.
[0:58:55] Albert Stoykov: Like, do I want to go this route and have the organizer and then the organizer name, then the.
[0:59:01] Albert Stoykov: An event and then the event name and a company and a company name.
[0:59:07] Albert Stoykov: So this is just hard coded on this page.
[0:59:10] Albert Stoykov: I can, I can obviously add it here if, if we think it would be better.
[0:59:15] Albert Stoykov: I mean, to me both, both, both make sense. Just what we decide.
[0:59:21] Albert Stoykov: But yeah, it kind of makes sense to have events here, slash, then the event name and then they can't click on the event name, but they can click on events which would take them back to this page.
[0:59:30] Nick Thompson: Yeah, yeah, yeah. If it's. I don't know if it's obvious enough. That's my, my only question with it.
[0:59:36] Nick Thompson: I think it would be intuitive if you.
[0:59:38] Nick Thompson: As long as you're looking at the breadcrumb trail, that's what you do.
[0:59:43] Nick Thompson: But it might, you know, probably doesn't need to be that obvious though, to be fair, because in general you've got to remember that everybody apart from us is, is generally focused on one event.
[0:59:55] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[0:59:55] Nick Thompson: So maybe changing events is actually quite a rare thing that they, they would want to be doing. Yeah.
[1:00:02] Albert Stoykov: But I think it's still helpful to have that up here if they do have multiple events because I think if they, if they don't realize they can click on this to change an event, they can clearly see change events here.
[1:00:13] Albert Stoykov: So I don't think this harms being there.
[1:00:26] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[1:00:26] Nick Thompson: But you can apply that to everything. You can just kind of go, I'll just.
[1:00:28] Nick Thompson: Why don't we stick one down the bottom as well? So they can, they can definitely don't miss that.
[1:00:34] Nick Thompson: They can change event.
[1:00:36] Nick Thompson: But what we actually really have to do is kind of say, well, is it, is it a priority thing?
[1:00:41] Nick Thompson: And would they miss it if it was, if it was say, breadcrumb trail.
[1:00:57] Nick Thompson: I keep coming back in my head to a hamburger menu. That's me.
[1:01:05] Nick Thompson: Maybe like near where the badge scanner logo is or something, or underneath it. So.
[1:01:14] Nick Thompson: I'm struggling with this so much.
[1:01:15] Nick Thompson: I think it's because we're, we've got an unusual system where we've got these levels where top levels can access the lower levels, but you don't really want the lower levels to have to know about the top levels, which is a very unusual sort of setup.
[1:01:32] Nick Thompson: It's not a traditional navigation structure, is it?
[1:01:36] Albert Stoykov: I, I would have thought that every, almost every system has like super admins or like.
[1:01:45] Albert Stoykov: User levels that are much higher, that are generally used by like employees. And not actual users.
[1:02:01] Nick Thompson: I'm struggling with it on this one anyway.
[1:02:07] Nick Thompson: Probably, probably because know we've chucked into AI and it's come up with something and then you kind of.
[1:02:14] Nick Thompson: It's hard to take the focus off that when you, when you're trying to think of things from scratch.
[1:02:19] Nick Thompson: If you like, if you think trying to think of most intuitive, you're looking at something that's not the most intuitive perhaps, and that's influencing.
[1:02:29] Nick Thompson: What you can visualize. To me it is anyway.
[1:02:37] Nick Thompson: Okay, well, I don't think that it's going to stop zir developing.
[1:02:42] Nick Thompson: You know, I think we, we do have the scope. We do need to get it off to him and let it build. I.
[1:02:52] Nick Thompson: I think people are going to struggle with those buttons at the top and realizing that they are actually buttons, not titles, and realizing to some extent where they are in.
[1:03:02] Nick Thompson: In the structure.
[1:03:04] Nick Thompson: For company admins, though, I'm kind of reassured by the fact that they don't have many levels to worry about.
[1:03:11] Nick Thompson: That's our main user. For the likes of Barry and stuff like that.
[1:03:18] Nick Thompson: I don't think it's going to be the most intuitive thing to navigate around and know where you are.
[1:03:25] Nick Thompson: Yeah, I think the main thing that's missing is kind of that it's a bit subtle saying what page you're on right now.
[1:03:32] Nick Thompson: It's a bit too subtle maybe, but I haven't got a better idea off the top of my head.
[1:03:36] Nick Thompson: So I think we should probably roll it out as it is and get moving rather than half things up.
[1:03:43] Nick Thompson: But take out, take out the my account thing, my dashboard link we spoke.
[1:03:49] Albert Stoykov: About before for the admin. Okay, cool.
[1:03:56] Nick Thompson: And make the changes that we talked about with. The event organizer dashboard. Taking out the metrics.
[1:04:05] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll watch the recording of this and I'll go through all those.
[1:04:12] Albert Stoykov: Everything we discussed. So I'll try my best to get that done by the end of today.
[1:04:23] Nick Thompson: Okay.
[1:04:24] Albert Stoykov: Dashboard.
[1:04:30] Nick Thompson: So it's just sent a message saying, sorry, I need figma design export as react code.
[1:04:36] Nick Thompson: You'll export it from GitHub now? I guess. Would you provide him with the GitHub?
[1:04:44] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah, I can give him access to the GitHub repo. Next thing on the list.
[1:04:54] Albert Stoykov: You said just labeling event management as just events. I assume you mean in here event management.
[1:05:05] Albert Stoykov: I think this makes sense because it's basically managing the event.
[1:05:10] Albert Stoykov: It's like I don't think if I change this to events and then it says manage companies, visitors and leads for this event.
[1:05:20] Albert Stoykov: I don't think that makes sense. I think event management makes sense here.
[1:05:25] Nick Thompson: Oh, sorry. This is within. Within an event.
[1:05:30] Albert Stoykov: Yes.
[1:05:32] Nick Thompson: Is there one on the. On the level up from this. The organizers.
[1:05:38] Albert Stoykov: So that's the event admin. Let me see. Event management. Oh, maybe you meant this one.
[1:05:49] Nick Thompson: I think I meant that one. Yeah.
[1:05:51] Albert Stoykov: Okay, cool. I can change that to events.
[1:06:00] Nick Thompson: Cool.
[1:06:03] Albert Stoykov: I think we can lose location. Yeah, you could. You mentioned that. Which is. Which is here.
[1:06:10] Albert Stoykov: So you want that to be replaced with the. You say visit account. Okay.
[1:06:23] Nick Thompson: Yeah. Okay.
[1:06:30] Albert Stoykov: Do we need a way for organizer stack to Be added. Yes, we've added this here.
[1:06:36] Albert Stoykov: So we've got event admins here and you can add a new event. Question is.
[1:06:47] Albert Stoykov: Question is, I think I noticed while you were playing around. I think at the moment this is.
[1:06:56] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, this is done in a way. So an event admin could add another event admin.
[1:07:01] Albert Stoykov: Do we want to allow this or not?
[1:07:08] Nick Thompson: Yeah, as long as I can't like add somebody. User level up from them.
[1:07:11] Nick Thompson: Yeah, I think that should be okay. You think of a reason why not?
[1:07:17] Albert Stoykov: No, just wanted to double check. In my eyes. Yeah. I doubt anyone's gonna. Abuse this. I get.
[1:07:27] Albert Stoykov: I think it's just a case of access for them.
[1:07:31] Albert Stoykov: And we do want to get to a point where people are managing their own events.
[1:07:38] Albert Stoykov: So I don't think we want to restrict how many admins they can have.
[1:07:43] Albert Stoykov: The more the better if we don't have to do the work. But yeah, just double check that with you.
[1:07:52] Nick Thompson: With version one, we've had to sort of.
[1:07:55] Nick Thompson: When we're adding event admins with like a series of checkboxes as to events that they are able to work on.
[1:08:07] Nick Thompson: This. We're already. We're only at the event admin state. We're an event level here, aren't we?
[1:08:12] Nick Thompson: A single event level. Right. So that's not going to be an issue.
[1:08:15] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. So they. So they can only add an event admin for that event.
[1:08:21] Nick Thompson: Right. For ourselves and for the reg boxes.
[1:08:27] Nick Thompson: The event organizers, have they got a capability to add users that are not. Companies?
[1:08:38] Albert Stoykov: That are not companies.
[1:08:42] Nick Thompson: Yeah. As in Redbox staff.
[1:08:46] Albert Stoykov: Redbook Organizer can come in, they can add an event.
[1:08:53] Albert Stoykov: They can select an event within that event, they can import companies, add companies, add visitors, look at the leads.
[1:09:03] Albert Stoykov: And then they can also add event admins for that specific event. Which I think is correct.
[1:09:09] Nick Thompson: Right. So if we wanted to add. Barry had his new.
[1:09:13] Nick Thompson: A new director and wanted to give them access across the events that red box are in, do they have a capability to do that.
[1:09:28] Nick Thompson: Or is it only you're. You can only add somebody and assign them to one event.
[1:09:44] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. So essentially you're saying that.
[1:09:48] Albert Stoykov: The way I've set this up at the moment, the event organizer, I'm treating it as a user and instead I should treat that as a company.
[1:09:57] Albert Stoykov: So I can assign multiple event organizers under that event organizer company.
[1:10:04] Nick Thompson: I think that's what he said. Okay. Okay.
[1:10:14] Albert Stoykov: So what I can do is I can add another tab here called. Organizers. Organizer users. Or just users.
[1:10:46] Nick Thompson: It needs thinking through because it's multi event.
[1:10:51] Albert Stoykov: What was that? Sorry.
[1:10:52] Nick Thompson: It needs thinking through because there's multiple events.
[1:10:55] Nick Thompson: Can you mind me just know how you store it in the database? We store it in the same table, don't we?
[1:11:01] Nick Thompson: That uses events. Right.
[1:11:28] Albert Stoykov: So we have event users, we have organizers. We have users. So a user. Is.
[1:11:53] Albert Stoykov: User is linked to an organizer ID. Yeah, they can be set to. User level 40.
[1:12:10] Albert Stoykov: Which then, which then means that they are. Event organizer. For that specific organizer id.
[1:12:22] Nick Thompson: Right.
[1:12:22] Albert Stoykov: So, so yeah, essentially in here you could have two rows, one with Barry and then one with his director and they're both linked, they're both linked to the same organizer ID and they all, they'll basically have access to, to this organized dashboard.
[1:12:39] Albert Stoykov: And down here, down here they can click on organizer users and then, then they can see the two accounts and potentially add, add more.
[1:12:49] Albert Stoykov: So I can have that?
[1:12:51] Nick Thompson: Okay, yeah, I think that would make sense.
[1:12:55] Albert Stoykov: Okay cool.
[1:12:57] Nick Thompson: So it lists people that are at a status of 40 or user level of 40 or, or above. Is that right?
[1:13:07] Albert Stoykov: Yes, above.
[1:13:07] Nick Thompson: Better. It's higher. Better with the user levels.
[1:13:11] Albert Stoykov: Well, it's more like equals 40 because then that makes them organize event organizers specifically.
[1:13:17] Nick Thompson: Okay.
[1:13:22] Albert Stoykov: And then yeah, if it's, if it's under then that, that, that would be event admins.
[1:13:29] Albert Stoykov: Which is specific to, to one event.
[1:13:35] Nick Thompson: Okay, yeah, I'm happy with that change. Oh, all right.
[1:13:41] Nick Thompson: I'd better give you some time to actually get on with it.
[1:13:43] Albert Stoykov: Albert Stoykov stopped sharing your screen
[1:13:44] Nick Thompson: Nick Thompson started sharing their screen
[1:13:44] Albert Stoykov: I went with co pilot. I'm like, Give me 15 minutes.
[1:13:48] Nick Thompson: Nick Thompson stopped sharing their screen
[1:13:52] Nick Thompson: Loving the confidence. That's quite different from the, you know, the trudging through Treacle.
[1:13:56] Nick Thompson: We were getting the Sigma up a while. I hope co pilot stays, stays that way.
[1:14:01] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, I had to, I had to to start like a free trial which is like a, a month long.
[1:14:08] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[1:14:09] Albert Stoykov: But yeah, I'm, I'm having an amazing, an amazing time.
[1:14:13] Nick Thompson: Right?
[1:14:14] Albert Stoykov: No, much, no, not much sleep but, but very, very excited that things are moving fast.
[1:14:22] Nick Thompson: Oh, well done for finding it by the way. What do you, what are the costs.
[1:14:27] Albert Stoykov: Going forward, you know. For this? I think, I think it's only like $10 a month or something.
[1:14:35] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, they might, they might be relating to like storing everything on GitHub when you push it, when we, when we push everything live like the website and the app.
[1:14:47] Albert Stoykov: But I think it would like, it's a no brainer because we'll be able to go in and see how everything works, see how everything's built, change things when we want to or like say we want to change the name of a tab.
[1:15:02] Albert Stoykov: Like we don't have to go to ZIA and say please change the name of this tab from this to this.
[1:15:10] Albert Stoykov: I think it just makes sense to be able to make small changes like that and obviously if it's something bigger that would require testing.
[1:15:16] Albert Stoykov: We can, we can like, we can create, I can create a poll like pull request and then submit it and the developers can have a look at it and either like accept it or say like this might break something and then like take it from there.
[1:15:31] Albert Stoykov: I think that would definitely expedite the development process.
[1:15:35] Nick Thompson: Right, okay, great. All right, terrific. Thank you very much.
[1:15:40] Nick Thompson: Be good to get a, a little demo from you year as to you know, how you're doing the copilot stuff.
[1:15:48] Nick Thompson: Okay. Yeah, give us a, give us a bit of a run through. Yeah, it's.
[1:15:56] Nick Thompson: I keep wondering whether it's worth doing a mini tech breed type thing on it.
[1:15:59] Nick Thompson: I don't know to what extent the other guys would be developing apps from scratch like this.
[1:16:07] Nick Thompson: So there might be other subjects that are more priority for them. Yeah.
[1:16:17] Albert Stoykov: I mean this might be like super cool if we could implement that with BadgeX but I think, I think access is built in a completely different way so it's not like, it's not a GitHub type version control.
[1:16:34] Albert Stoykov: So yeah, I don't think that'll be possible. If it was it would have been amazing.
[1:16:39] Albert Stoykov: Like projects would have been mad.
[1:16:45] Albert Stoykov: But yeah it's, it's very good because it's essentially looking at your entire code base and it can, it can read different files.
[1:16:53] Albert Stoykov: You can give it specific files with instructions what to do, what not to do, what to touch, what not to touch.
[1:16:59] Albert Stoykov: So it's, and it's like, it gives it like context every, every time you give it a prompt.
[1:17:06] Albert Stoykov: So it's, it's not losing context as easily.
[1:17:13] Nick Thompson: That's good, that's really good. I'll give you a very quick Whiz3.
[1:17:17] Nick Thompson: You mentioned about having a designer the other day so I just sent you a link on the chat where I, where I've got to.
[1:17:25] Nick Thompson: This is, this is let's say three quarter functional.
[1:17:31] Nick Thompson: There's, there's definitely some things in it that you know like you find with Figma.
[1:17:35] Nick Thompson: It's kind of like you think you're going to get there with it but it's just couldn't quite get over the finish line which this co pilot stuff might, might help with.
[1:17:44] Albert Stoykov: So you made this with Figma make?
[1:17:46] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[1:17:48] Albert Stoykov: And you want to, and you want to put this on the website so that people can design their own badge and submit It.
[1:17:56] Albert Stoykov: Submit it that way.
[1:17:57] Nick Thompson: That's my thought, is essentially you, yeah, kind of want to work with our shopping cart where, yeah, ideally we kind of get to a stage where we can just say, you know, order by 12 o', clock, you'll get your badges like next day or something like that.
[1:18:11] Nick Thompson: You know, we could really speed it up because we'd know all we're getting is a PDF.
[1:18:16] Nick Thompson: All we've got to do is print that PDF out and you know, and shape, you know, round the corners and punch the holes, whatever.
[1:18:26] Nick Thompson: So it would potentially just take a whole load of labor away and mean that we could just churn out a lot more jobs a lot more quickly and really up the service.
[1:18:37] Nick Thompson: So give you a quick walk around or do you want to do a screen share?
[1:18:44] Albert Stoykov: Yep. Do you want to share? Because you're familiar with it. Yeah.
[1:18:50] Nick Thompson: Nick Thompson started sharing their screen
[1:18:52] Albert Stoykov: But yeah, that definitely looks like something we could finish with. Copilot.
[1:18:59] Nick Thompson: Okay, that's great.
[1:19:02] Albert Stoykov: So I've lost all confidence in the thing we make.
[1:19:09] Nick Thompson: So you've got your different badge types here. ASICS compact.
[1:19:15] Nick Thompson: So ASICS compact, credit card, landscape or portrait.
[1:19:20] Nick Thompson: So I've gone with a six at the moment and you've got all your common fields here.
[1:19:26] Nick Thompson: So I can chuck in full name.
[1:19:28] Nick Thompson: Oh, by the way, this is, this is running off a little sample data set which is driven up here.
[1:19:33] Nick Thompson: I can add in full name. Job title, company. Once I've got those controls.
[1:19:41] Nick Thompson: I've got sets here like I could include the prefix like mister, Mrs. Doctor etc.
[1:19:49] Nick Thompson: I could add a line break in to go. I want that to be first name, above, above surname.
[1:19:56] Nick Thompson: I could drag these around. I can resize. You see, this one is not on a.
[1:20:06] Nick Thompson: Auto shrink to fit which I can turn on or off. Change your fonts.
[1:20:15] Nick Thompson: The fonts are going to be a little bit tricky because you've got to have licenses for fonts that you make available for things like this, I think.
[1:20:24] Nick Thompson: But this is also the Google fonts that you could choose from. You've got.
[1:20:37] Nick Thompson: Background color on the main color. You've got. Oh, this, this I thought would be nice if I put.
[1:20:46] Nick Thompson: So I bring in an image. The images isn't quite working as nicely as I wanted, but let's just try it.
[1:20:53] Nick Thompson: I'll choose a file. And. Sort of nasty image. It's going back. This is what's going wrong at the moment.
[1:21:07] Nick Thompson: It's duplicating the image and I'm struggling a bit.
[1:21:09] Nick Thompson: When I resize it, it's making like another copy of it could do something like that and then put a background color.
[1:21:18] Nick Thompson: On this. And then if I don't want it to be completely opaque, I could, you know, have a.
[1:21:27] Nick Thompson: Got the opacity. Well, there's this resizing of the images stuff is really not good.
[1:21:55] Nick Thompson: That's not the best design I'm doing here, but you kind of get the idea. I've got the.
[1:22:04] Nick Thompson: We put in a QR code. And that's a personalized QR code out box. Oops. What's it got? Dropping.
[1:22:16] Nick Thompson: There it is. He's got. Yeah, sort general sort of standard design stuff.
[1:22:23] Nick Thompson: So I can change the border width on an item, make it a different color. Go for dashed or whatever.
[1:22:43] Albert Stoykov: So when they submit that, would that be.
[1:22:47] Albert Stoykov: Would that arrive to the production team as a ready PDF for them to. Send?
[1:22:57] Nick Thompson: So at the moment I'm just trying to remember where I got to with this. Oh, by the way.
[1:23:02] Nick Thompson: So before I just do that. So I have got like a data editor here. So this is a sample. Sample stuff.
[1:23:07] Nick Thompson: But I could. You can add in records and, you know, the idea is you'd be able to import.
[1:23:12] Nick Thompson: Import a set of records. If you need to. Or they send us. They send us.
[1:23:22] Nick Thompson: So I'm not very giving words today.
[1:23:26] Albert Stoykov: Spreadsheet.
[1:23:27] Nick Thompson: If they send us a spreadsheet and then they just use this to come up with the design and they just said, yeah, I've seen the sample records in it.
[1:23:35] Nick Thompson: Here's my data. Kind of off you go. Then that could be kind of a halfway house.
[1:23:42] Nick Thompson: But I mean, I think in an ideal world, I probably wanted to just import all their data and then be able to.
[1:23:47] Nick Thompson: Then be able to see every single record.
[1:23:50] Nick Thompson: As long as we could do it in a way that they couldn't then go off and print it themselves, then I think that wouldn't be a bad thing.
[1:23:58] Nick Thompson: So if I go export PDF. Should hopefully work. It's a while since I've done this. There we go.
[1:24:15] Nick Thompson: Might be a bit bigger with it being having images and stuff, but let's open that up.
[1:24:22] Albert Stoykov: Was that 46 megabytes?
[1:24:26] Nick Thompson: Yeah, but it's doing one for every person. I don't know what's happened with the person's name.
[1:24:31] Nick Thompson: There's obviously a glitch there.
[1:24:33] Albert Stoykov: Oh, okay. That's pretty good. So it literally exports.
[1:24:36] Albert Stoykov: Wait, but you don't want to give that to the person. They can just go and.
[1:24:41] Nick Thompson: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, but you could do something clever like you could say.
[1:24:48] Albert Stoykov: No, you want to email this and send it to Ben and he just presses print or he sends. It.
[1:24:59] Nick Thompson: Could be something they can only see in a preview window in the. In the design a bit.
[1:25:05] Nick Thompson: So rather than them exporting a PDF, it could.
[1:25:07] Nick Thompson: Yeah, it could just be something like preview, but they've got no way to save it.
[1:25:11] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[1:25:12] Nick Thompson: But when they click buy, then the PDF goes off to us. Cool.
[1:25:21] Albert Stoykov: Sounds good.
[1:25:25] Nick Thompson: So, yeah, there's. There's a few glitches. Bomb. Yeah, you copilot stuff might be the solution here.
[1:25:30] Nick Thompson: Just finding time to get all the stuff done, isn't it?
[1:25:33] Nick Thompson: You got zoom control, so you can do the fine detail stuff. You can see where the holes are. They're.
[1:25:39] Nick Thompson: They're fixed, whereas everything else is movable. There's an awful lot I've been able to do with it.
[1:25:43] Nick Thompson: Can you.
[1:25:44] Albert Stoykov: Can you change the whole. The holes?
[1:25:49] Nick Thompson: Well, it's just part. It's part of the layout. So if I go to. Compact, you know.
[1:25:56] Nick Thompson: Oh, there is actually an option, I think, somewhere. Here we go. Yeah. Holes for double hole.
[1:26:02] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, yeah.
[1:26:04] Nick Thompson: Or I could go double slot or something.
[1:26:11] Nick Thompson: Had to find some way to kind of make sure that spec came through so that it was actually printed in the right way.
[1:26:17] Nick Thompson: Because it obviously doesn't have the holes on the PDF. So they don't get printed.
[1:26:26] Albert Stoykov: Yeah. Yeah.
[1:26:30] Nick Thompson: That's just where I went with it. I was trying to get really clever with it and it didn't work.
[1:26:36] Nick Thompson: This IDML thing. So that's an InDesign file. What's like InDesign metalanguage?
[1:26:41] Nick Thompson: The idea being it's more editable.
[1:26:45] Nick Thompson: Or that it was sort of like a bit of an open language for InDesign.
[1:26:50] Nick Thompson: But this isn't creating compatible files like actually open in InDesign. So that's not worked.
[1:26:58] Nick Thompson: Import CSV. Did we get that working? Oh, yeah.
[1:27:03] Nick Thompson: So export CSV, I think, gives you a template and then import CSV you can use to get your data in.
[1:27:09] Nick Thompson: I think that was working. Also. These aren't working.
[1:27:16] Nick Thompson: I was trying to get like, you know, if you wanted to have a. A shape or something like that.
[1:27:20] Nick Thompson: But it's a bit gimmicky. Don't really need that necessarily.
[1:27:25] Nick Thompson: Oh, this is the thing Murray really likes. So it's a bit of a. It's not. It's not quite working. Right.
[1:27:34] Nick Thompson: But, you know, like, see it 3D. You can flip it over. There's a. There's a backside. Something screwed.
[1:27:51] Nick Thompson: Is it gone?
[1:27:55] Albert Stoykov: I think that 3D is nice.
[1:27:59] Albert Stoykov: You should put it straight into the editor so you can make the edits and you can still.
[1:28:06] Nick Thompson: Yeah.
[1:28:08] Albert Stoykov: Or edit it in 3D, although it might confuse the controls of what you're trying to do.
[1:28:14] Albert Stoykov: Are you adding an image or are you flipping it around?
[1:28:20] Nick Thompson: Yeah, it's amazing when I was playing around it, how quickly you could build a good looking badge, which is the idea to give them something they can just get on with and it's reasonably intuitive but it gives them the power to.
[1:28:37] Albert Stoykov: And that could save so much time for Ben and Antonio and like back and forth with the client.
[1:28:42] Albert Stoykov: Like, are you happy with this design? Are you happy with that design?
[1:28:45] Nick Thompson: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[1:28:48] Albert Stoykov: I mean, I doubt, I doubt they'll import the visitor data as well because it's like they always provide it last minute.
[1:28:56] Albert Stoykov: But they can, they can still put like first name, last name, company name, job title, send, send like a.
[1:29:03] Albert Stoykov: Tests like test data with like showing all the columns that, that they're going to have and then.
[1:29:13] Albert Stoykov: Pretty. Pretty straightforward.
[1:29:16] Nick Thompson: Yeah. Need some thought around that.
[1:29:18] Nick Thompson: And also there's some people that have got their data so got their designs in say indesign and I haven't got a way to really kind of get those designs transferred over at the moment, but maybe that's just something we just go, well, that doesn't do that.
[1:29:32] Nick Thompson: You know, it's not designed for that purpose.
[1:29:35] Nick Thompson: You know, if I think about say clients like imagination and.
[1:29:40] Nick Thompson: Identity and stuff where they've probably gone to their clients and gone, here's the design for a badge, what do you think?
[1:29:45] Nick Thompson: And got approval and then they come to us, they've already got that, you know, in a different format.
[1:29:52] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, but if they have that already, they can, they can just send that to Ben and Ben loads it locally and he can see it.
[1:29:59] Albert Stoykov: So it's already built. They don't need a badge builder.
[1:30:05] Nick Thompson: Yeah. This is half the problem is working out what exactly, what clients is it working for?
[1:30:16] Nick Thompson: Who are the people who would use this above, say towards someone like Ben?
[1:30:22] Albert Stoykov: Yeah.
[1:30:23] Nick Thompson: Need some more thinking through, but I thought I'd just give you a quick tour anyway.
[1:30:27] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, I'd say it's more for like new users that maybe haven't used us before or even if they have this, this would give them the ability to like change something if they want to or like show us what they want to be changed and how.
[1:30:45] Nick Thompson: So. Okay. Yeah, all right. I will let you go.
[1:30:55] Nick Thompson: Obviously I haven't got your review done this side of Christmas.
[1:31:00] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, we said. You said, yeah, you said you will do in January. That's, that's totally fine.
[1:31:07] Nick Thompson: Brilliant. Okay. All right, Great stuff. All right, thank you very much, Albert.
[1:31:12] Albert Stoykov: Thank you.
[1:31:13] Nick Thompson: And so you'll work on those changes today.
[1:31:16] Nick Thompson: Just, you know, let me know where you've got to end of the day, if you've got.
[1:31:21] Nick Thompson: If I can send Z the link or if you've got stuff. Outstanding.
[1:31:25] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, I'll try, yeah, I'll try my best to. To get all this through the line today and then I'll.
[1:31:34] Albert Stoykov: Yeah, I'll. I'll push that to the, to the live so you can.
[1:31:38] Albert Stoykov: You can see all the latest changes and then it's up to you if you want to send it to 0, not buy.
[1:31:44] Albert Stoykov: I assume we want to. Wanna pull the trigger on that and. Yeah, get it, get it going.
[1:31:49] Nick Thompson: All right, brilliant. And he's asked us about the react file, so we'll give him the GitHub.
[1:31:56] Nick Thompson: You'll share the GitHub repository with him or something? Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. Great.
[1:32:03] Nick Thompson: All right, well, if I don't speak to you beforehand, have a lovely break.
[1:32:06] Albert Stoykov: Thank you.
[1:32:07] Nick Thompson: I'm with the little ones. Thank you. You too. You're going away somewhere.
[1:32:12] Albert Stoykov: No, no, no, he's. He's way too. He's way too small. I mean, we might. We might go.
[1:32:17] Albert Stoykov: Go for Christmas to visit the families, but we'll see if everyone's healthy and yeah, the roads are not.
[1:32:24] Albert Stoykov: If we're not snowed in, then, yeah, we might go, but other than that would be. Be at home sleeping.
[1:32:33] Nick Thompson: Awesome. All right, we'll enjoy. And yeah, thank you. Lovely, lovely family time.
[1:32:38] Albert Stoykov: Thank you. And yeah, I hope you have a nice time at the party today. Say hi to everyone.

Meeting: Albert / Nick - TBS v2 update | AI Notes by Fellow

Summary
Nick and Albert conducted a detailed UI/UX review of their TBS v2 dashboard system, focusing on interface improvements and functionality enhancements. Albert shared how he transitioned from Figma to coding directly with VS Code and Copilot, achieving a 60-70% success rate with the AI assistant. They extensively reviewed the Super Admin dashboard's calendar functionality, deciding to implement scroll functionality for multiple events and prioritize functionality over aesthetics. The team agreed on numerous UI refinements including standardizing export buttons to blue, reorganizing dashboard elements to prioritize key metrics, and simplifying navigation by removing redundant options like "My Dashboard" for administrators. They addressed user permission structures, confirming that event admins should be able to add other admins of equal or lower permission levels. Nick also demonstrated a badge design tool built with Figma Make featuring customizable fields, design options, and preview capabilities that could significantly streamline their production workflow.

Action items

- Albert Stoykov: Change "Send location" to "visitors" in the dashboard section. 0:39:08
- Albert Stoykov: Fix missing breadcrumb navigation element to include user name (Jane Smith) in the team member view. 0:50:25
- Albert Stoykov: Remove the "My Dashboard" option for administrators in the navigation structure. 0:51:34
- Albert Stoykov: Implement all discussed UI changes by end of day, including removing the "my account/my dashboard" link and metrics from the event organizer dashboard. 1:04:05
- Albert Stoykov: Provide access to the GitHub repository for the Figma design export as React code. 1:04:36
- Albert Stoykov: Complete website/app changes and push to the live environment by end of day. 1:31:13
- Albert Stoykov: Share GitHub repository containing the React files with Z. 1:31:49

Decisions
- For the Super Admin dashboard, the team agreed to prioritize functionality over aesthetics in the calendar feature implementation. 0:15:50
- The calendar tooltips should remain visible when users attempt to click on them to ensure proper interaction with multiple events. 0:17:48
- The calendar functionality should be designed to scale for handling up to five or six events per day as the maximum expected volume. 0:18:04
- Add scroll functionality to tooltips when displaying multiple events, allowing users to scroll through and click on specific items. 0:19:18
- Implement scrolling for potential issues and recently finished events sections rather than allowing them to expand indefinitely. 0:19:54
- Clicking on issue notifications (like "unmatched scans") will automatically apply appropriate filters to quickly show the relevant problematic items. 0:25:59
- Remove items with zero issues from the dashboard display rather than showing them with a zero value. 0:26:34
- Remove the company performance section from the organizer-level dashboard view as it isn't relevant at this level. 0:35:46
- Reorganize dashboard elements by moving key metrics to the top while removing less valuable information sections. 0:38:15
- Standardize all export buttons to be blue across dashboards, while keeping import buttons black for visual differentiation. 0:40:45
- Remove the "My Dashboard" option for administrators to simplify navigation, requiring users to access personal data through the team dashboard instead. 0:51:34
- Proceed with the current UI design despite some navigation concerns to avoid delaying development, while removing the "my account" link and metrics from the event organizer dashboard. 1:03:36
- Keep "Event Management" label within an event context, but change the upper-level navigation item from "Event Management" to "Events". 1:05:51
- Replace the "Location" section with "Visit Account" in the interface. 1:06:10
- Allow event admins to add other event admins for the same event, as long as they cannot add users with higher permission levels than themselves. 1:07:08
- Implement a structure where organizer users can be listed and managed by adding a new tab for "Organizer Users" or "Users". 1:12:51

Topics
Development Workflow Improvements
- Albert moved from Figma to developing code locally using VS Code and Copilot due to Figma's server issues. The new workflow proved significantly more efficient without the unintended side effects that occurred with Figma. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=580">0:09:40</a>
- The development process involved pulling all existing content from Figma, using GitHub for version control, and deploying to a URL to share with the team. Albert still kept Figma open for reference to locate specific elements. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=636">0:10:36</a>
- Copilot integration proved to be highly beneficial, with 60-70% success rate on first attempt instructions. Albert even started using speech-to-text to further streamline his workflow. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=773">0:12:53</a>
- Albert explained the cost of using GitHub is approximately $10 per month, noting this investment would allow them to make their own changes to the website and app without having to go through ZIA for minor updates. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4467">1:14:27</a>
- Albert detailed how GitHub Copilot analyzes the entire codebase, reads different files, accepts specific instructions about what to modify, and maintains context between prompts, significantly accelerating development. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4605">1:16:45</a>

Dashboard Calendar Functionality
- The Super Admin Dashboard was updated based on Nick's previous feedback. The team added a calendar functionality that displays upcoming events with hover functionality showing event details. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=872">0:14:32</a>
- Current implementation uses color splitting to show multiple events on the same day, though Albert noted he's not completely satisfied with this approach and was still working on animations to improve it. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=934">0:15:34</a>
- Discussion about potentially extending the calendar functionality to other user levels such as event organizers who might have multiple events in a month for easier navigation. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=957">0:15:57</a>
- The team agreed the system should be designed to handle up to five or six events per day as the expected maximum, with functionality prioritized over aesthetics. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=1084">0:18:04</a>
- Albert suggested implementing scroll functionality for multiple events in tooltips, allowing users to scroll through and click on specific events. This feature was applied to upcoming events, potential issues, and recently finished events sections. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=1158">0:19:18</a>

Interface Navigation Structure
- Nick identified issues with the navigation system, noting that dashboard buttons weren't visually distinct enough from titles, creating confusion when users navigate between different sections. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=2376">0:39:36</a>
- Albert explained that different user roles (super admin, event admin, company admin) have different navigation options, with lower-level users having more navigational buttons available. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=2407">0:40:07</a>
- Nick pointed out that users might not initially recognize the breadcrumb as clickable navigation. Version one handled this better with blue for clickable elements and gray for non-clickable items. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=3375">0:56:15</a>
- Nick highlighted the unusual navigation structure challenge where top-level users need access to lower levels without lower-level users needing to know about higher levels. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=3675">1:01:15</a>
- They decided to remove the "My Dashboard" option for administrators, simplifying navigation by allowing users to access personal data through the team dashboard instead. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=3061">0:51:01</a>
- They discussed whether the breadcrumb approach would be obvious enough, ultimately concluding that it's less critical because most users focus on managing a single event rather than frequently switching between multiple events. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=3583">0:59:43</a>

User Permission Management
- They discussed whether event admins should be able to add other event admins. Nick approved this functionality provided that users cannot add someone with a higher user level than themselves. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4007">1:06:47</a>
- Albert realized they needed to treat event organizers as companies rather than individual users, allowing for multiple event organizers under one event organizer company. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4184">1:09:44</a>
- Albert explained the database structure where users with level 40 are linked to an organizer ID, giving them event organizer access. This allows multiple people (like Barry and his director) to have organizer-level access. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4342">1:12:22</a>
- They confirmed that user level 40 specifically designates event organizers, while lower levels represent event admins who are specific to one event. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4402">1:13:22</a>

Issue Notification System
- Albert confirmed that issues inside the inbox are now clickable, directing users to the specific associated events when clicked. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=1496">0:24:56</a>
- Nick noted that clicking on issue notifications (like "23 unmatched scans") doesn't directly highlight the issues themselves, requiring extra steps to locate the specific problematic items. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=1505">0:25:05</a>
- They agreed to implement a solution where clicking on issue notifications would automatically apply appropriate filters to quickly show the relevant items (like unmatched scans or inactive companies). <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=1559">0:25:59</a>
- Nick asked if zero-value items should be displayed or removed entirely. They decided that items with zero issues should not be displayed on the dashboard. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=1592">0:26:32</a>

Dashboard Layout Optimization
- The team discussed key metrics on the dashboard. Nick identified that specific data elements (like lead quality and event averages) were the most valuable for users and should be prioritized at the top of the dashboard. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=2230">0:37:10</a>
- They agreed to reorganize the dashboard by moving important metrics to the top, while removing several less useful elements. Some information would be repositioned underneath the primary metrics. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=2295">0:38:15</a>
- Nick suggested reorganizing the dashboard layout, noting that the current arrangement had event-related sections separated by an unrelated section. He proposed moving the calendar lower and issues higher. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=1638">0:27:18</a>
- Albert explained his design rationale for separating upcoming and recently completed events with the potential issues section between them to avoid confusion. He argued that calendar should remain at the top for easy scanning. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=1683">0:28:03</a>
- They concluded that the company performance section wasn't relevant at the organizer level and agreed to remove the entire middle section from the organizer view while keeping calendar and events at the top. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=2146">0:35:46</a>

Badge Designer Tool
- Nick demonstrated a badge design tool built with Figma Make, showing various badge types (ASICS compact, credit card, landscape, portrait) with customizable fields including name, job title, and company. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4742">1:19:02</a>
- The tool includes robust design features: prefix options, line breaks, drag-and-resize functionality, font selection, background colors, image import (with some glitches), QR code generation, and border customization options. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4789">1:19:49</a>
- The system includes a data editor for sample records and CSV import/export functionality, though there are still questions about how clients would submit their data and whether they should be able to see all records. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=4982">1:23:02</a>
- A 3D preview feature allows users to flip the badge design to see both sides, though Nick noted this functionality needs improvement, as does the ability to transfer designs from InDesign to the platform. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=5245">1:27:25</a>
- Albert highlighted how the tool could save significant time for production team members Ben and Antonio by reducing back-and-forth with clients on design approvals, though questions remain about which clients would benefit most from this tool. <a href="/stream/Tm90ZVN0cmVhbToyZjQ5ZjZtb3BpMjdlam5zcmwzNXVucWx1bzptZWV0aW5nOjE3NDgyMg==/#Tm90ZTo2MzY4NDUxOA==//recording/TWVldGluZ1JlY29yZGluZzo4ODY5OTYy&ts=5317">1:28:37</a>
